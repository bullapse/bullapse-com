            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="abdesc">
                <p>My name is Spencer Bull, and I am a Senior Computer Science student/developer that is passionate about the evolution of new technologies. I have attended the University of Texas at Austin for four years pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and completing a McCombs Business Foundations Certificate.</p>

                <h3>Dell Technologies (2016-Present)</h3>
                <p>I currently work at Dell Technologies on the Client Solutions team in the CTO's office. We are working to create an iot framework in multiple languages. During the summer I integrated a third party complex event processor (CEP) using websockets and the JAVA Spring Integration Framework. I also created a notification service and an inhouse dynamic machine learning (ML) module, in python, that dynamically selects the most effective ML algorithm to use after giving a training dataaset. Live data could then be pumped through the model to determine if the data was considered good or bad data using supervised training. I am continuing to work as an intern at Dell Technologies until I begin working there full time this summer.</p>

                <h3>Target (2015 Summer)</h3>
                <p>I also worked for Target as an Software Archetect and Engineer Intern where I derived and implemented a solution to integrate an autonomous locker pickup solution for online purchases. I got to work directly with the technology to develop a solution to dynamically add certian orders to be picked up at a locker rather than at a customer service desk.</p>

                <h3>Ctuit (2013 and 2014 Summer)</h3>
                <p>I was a two year intern at Ctuit Software helping develop financial reports with Active Reports Software customized with other in-house software solutions. I accomplished many other tasks while interning at Ctuit Software such as: building a server rack, participating in quality assurance, finding other unique ways to deliver financial information , developing for Google Glass, and developing for Android wear.</p>
